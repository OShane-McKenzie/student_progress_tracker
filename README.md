## Platform and Compatibility

The application was developed on Arch Linux (EndeavourOS) KDE Plasma Desktop (X11) installed on a Surface Book 3 with a 3000x2000 screen. Therefore, there might be some scaling issues on other platforms.

There is a scaling functionality in the app which is disabled by default. You can enable it to experiment with it.
